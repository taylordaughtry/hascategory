# hasCategory for ExpressionEngine
**Easily determine whether an expressionengine entry has a category.**

ExpressionEngine makes it hard to work directly with Categories. Simple tasks like checking whether an entry has a certain category isn't as easy as you'd think. hasCategory is a simple plugin that adds a template tag you can pass to an `if` statement to make building your templates easier.

## Usage

hasCategory has one tag:

```html
{exp:hascategory entry='{entry_id}' category_id='123'}"} // Returns true/false
```

You'll probably want to drop this into an EE conditional, and hasCategory works just fine with that:

```html
{if "{exp:hascategory entry='{entry_id}' category_id='123'}"} [Outputs when entry has the category] {/if}
```

(Note: you'll want to keep the quotes in there so EE doesn't pitch a fit about parse order.)

## Parameters


| Parameter | Explanation  |
|:-------------:| -----|
| entry | The id of the entry you'd like to check for categories |
| category_id | The specific category's ID that you're checking |

## Contributing to hasCategory

In lieu of adding formal contribution guidlines, simply use the current format of the code as it isâ€”tabs, not spaces, with a tab-length of 4. In the interests of performance, I'd like to keep this plugin as slim as possible. If you'd like other features, let me know and I'll see about adding them.
